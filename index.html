                    Netflix started with movie
                </h2>
                <p> Netflix was started in 1998 to allow users to buy and rent DVDs by mail. By 2000, 
                    it included a user-driven rating system that gave personalized recommendations. The 
                    company went public in 2002, and hit 5 million users by 2006. In 2007, Netflix 
                    launched a streaming service in the US, which would spread to almost 200 countries 
                    worldwide by 2016. Netflix original programming began in 2013 with series, 
                    expanding to movies in 2015. Currently Netflix has over 200 million subscribers and 
                    hundreds of original movies and series, several of which are award-winning.

                    Hulu started with TV
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hulu started on the web, launching in 2008 to allow viewers to watch TV shows, 
                    subsequent to its founding in 2007. Hulu was originally part of NBC, and now is 
                    owned by Disney. Hulu's streaming subscription service became available in the 
                    United States in 2010, reaching 1 million subscribers in 2011, and 12 million 
                    subscribers by 2016. Hulu began creating content in 2011, and has continued 
                    to produce both movies and original series. While still only available in the US, 
                    Hulu offers many options to its subscribers, including prestige TV add-ons, 
                    commercial free programming, and streaming of live TV channels.

                    How do Netflix and Hulu compare?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here, we will look at programming on Netflix and Hulu from 2017-2021 using publicly 
                    available data from Kaggle, considering differences between them, but also the 
                    nature of the streaming landscape more generally over time. The original data 
                    sources are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Netflix: <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-show">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-show</a></li>
                        <li>Hulu: <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/hulu-movies-and-tv-shows">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/hulu-movies-and-tv-shows</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will explore the following questions: 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Are the origins of Netflix and Hulu represented by the proportions of movies to TV 
                            shows that they offer?</li>
                        <li>Since Hulu is only available in the US, is more of the content created in the US?</li>
                        <li>How did content offerings change during the pandemic period?</li>
                    </ol>
