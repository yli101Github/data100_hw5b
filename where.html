            <p>Hulu is only offered in the United States, but Netflix has a global presence. 
                However, that has to do with viewers, not creators. Where is content made?</p>

            <p>Netflix leverages international creators, with nearly 60% of its content from 2017
                2021 created entirely outside of the United States, or by international creators in 
                partnership with the United States. Unfortunately, much of the information on the 
                origin of programs is missing for Hulu in the data set. However, from the data we 
                do have, we see that a larger percentage of content was produced exclusively in the 
                United States (30%) versus content with an international component (19%).</p>
